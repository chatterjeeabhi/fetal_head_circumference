Project Title: Fetal Growth Head Circumference Prediction using U-Net Deep Learning

Project Description:
In this ambitious project, I led the development of a state-of-the-art deep learning model for predicting fetal head circumference from ultrasound images, crucial for monitoring fetal growth during pregnancy. The project employed a U-Net architecture, renowned for its prowess in medical image segmentation tasks, to accurately delineate the head region in ultrasound scans. Fetal head circumference serves as a vital indicator of fetal development and overall health, making its accurate estimation imperative for obstetricians and gynecologists. Leveraging a large dataset of annotated ultrasound images spanning various gestational ages, I meticulously trained and fine-tuned the U-Net model to learn intricate spatial features representative of fetal head anatomy. Through rigorous experimentation and optimization, I ensured the model's ability to generalize across diverse fetal head shapes, sizes, and orientations encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, I integrated advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's robustness and mitigate overfitting. The performance of the model was comprehensively evaluated using standard regression metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods. By accurately predicting fetal head circumference, this innovative deep learning solution holds immense potential to revolutionize prenatal care, enabling early detection of abnormalities and facilitating personalized healthcare interventions.
